          Angieneer is my personal brand — a combination of my name, Anggi, and
          engineer — representing my journey in building, learning, and growing
          as a future engineer. It reflects my passion for technology,
          creativity, and problem-solving, as well as my commitment to
          continuously improving my skills. Through Angieneer, I showcase the
          projects I build, the ideas I explore, and the lessons I learn along
          the way. It is not just a portfolio, but a space where I document my
          progress, experiment with new technologies, and shape my identity as
          an engineer who strives to create meaningful and impactful solutions.
